        "body" : "Fire is the visible effect of the process of combustion a special type of chemical reaction. It occurs between oxygen in the air and some sort of fuel. The products from the chemical reaction are completely different from the starting material.\n\nThe fuel must be heated to its ignition temperature for combustion to occur. The reaction will keep going as long as there is enough heat, fuel and oxygen. This is known as the fire triangle.\n\nCombustion is when fuel reacts with oxygen to release heat energy. Combustion can be slow or fast depending on the amount of oxygen available. Combustion that results in a flame is very fast and is called burning. Combustion can only occur between gases.\n\nFuels can be solids, liquids or gases. During the chemical reaction that produces fire, fuel is heated to such an extent that (if not already a gas) it releases gases from its surface.\n\nOnly gases can react in combustion. Gases are made up of molecules (groups of atoms). When these gases are hot enough, the molecules in the gases break apart and fragments of molecules re-join with oxygen from the air to make new product molecules – water molecules (H2O) and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) – and other products if burning is not complete.\n",

Cheetahs in the wild (Both male and female combined) have an average age span of 10 – 12 years. \n\n\nThe average lifespan of an adult male in the wild skews lower (8 years), due in part to territorial conflicts with competing groups of males.\n",

New research uncovers the steps leading up to this remarkable prosocial behavior and the importance of mutual grooming.\n\nVampire bats share their blood meals, but they don’t do this with just any ol’ bat. These flying mammals are known to form tight social bonds and build relationships that last for years. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, they actually seem to have friends.\n",
